This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates potential stack overflow errors and unhandled negative input within recursive functions.  The `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` functions use recursion, which can lead to stack overflow issues if the input values are excessively large.  Additionally, the functions don't explicitly handle negative input values, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.  The `bugSolution.hack` file provides a corrected version addressing these issues.
